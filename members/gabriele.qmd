Gabriele joined the lab in October 2024 as a research assistant after getting a masterâ€™s degree from the University of Trento, Italy. His work focuses primarily on curating and processing  multimodal MRI images from the ROSMAP dataset, a great resource for research on aging and neurodegenerative disease. He is particularly interested in brain connectivity, both structural and functional, and how network-based approaches can help unravel complex mechanisms underlying cognition and pathology. 

Outside the lab, Gabriele enjoys spending free time with friends, cooking new recipes, playing sports and exploring nature through hiking.
