:::{#hero-heading}

Jonathan is a PhD student studying how brain connectivity changes across aging and Alzheimer’s disease. With a background in statistics and cognitive science, his work focuses on large-scale neuroimaging datasets to better understand how functional brain networks reorganize in the face of pathology.

On his free time Jonathan enjoys building and tinkering -- whether it’s constructing a tiny self-sufficient house, developing new brain visualization tools, or building various applications. If a problem exists he likes trying to solve it (though he admits he often creates new ones in the process).
