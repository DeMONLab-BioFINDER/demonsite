Gabriele joined the lab in 2023 September after graduating with a degree in Molecular Cell Biology. With a background in wet-lab biology, she now applies single-cell transcriptomics and computational approaches to study cellular and molecular mechanisms of Alzheimerâ€™s disease.

In her free time, Gabriele enjoys sailing, both recreationally and competitively, having sailed all over Europe and with dreams to one day make a journey across the Atlantic.
